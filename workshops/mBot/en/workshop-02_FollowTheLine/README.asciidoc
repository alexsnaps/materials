= Workshop 02 - Follow the line

In this workshop we will be using the sensor below the robot: the line follower.

== Step 1: Discover the line follower
Let us discover what this line follower is about & we can use it.

The mBot is equiped with a line follower component. It is itself composed of two infrared sensors (sensor1 & sensor2).
Each of which has a transmitter and receiver part.

Write and execute the following program to discover how it is being used.

Look into these situations:

|         2+^| Sensor 1     2+^| Sensor 2        2+^| values 
|Situation 1:| No signal  |0 | No signal  | 0 | 00 | 0
|Situation 2:| No signal  |0 | Signal     | 1 | 01 | 1
|Situation 3:| Signal     |1 | No signal  | 0 | 10 | 2
|Situation 4:| Signal     |1 | Signal     | 1 | 11 | 3
|===

The values sent by each sensor is a binary value, either 0 or 1. The two values are then also interpreted as binary values, e.g. `10b` is equivalent to 
`2` in base 10, the base we commonly use to count.

== Step 2: Don't fall of the table

This step's objective is to have the robot stop if it realizes it's about to fall off.
 
For this to work, we need to have the mBot on a white, or a light colored, table. The robot is expected to stop as soon as it arrives to the edge.

- Copy the following program :

image::../../resources/images/Workshop2_Step2_EN.png[Siveur de ligne, link="../../resources/images/Workshop2_Step1_EN.png"] 

- Connect to the robot & execute the program. 
- Are you able to explain the different parts of this program?

== Step 3: Follow the line.

- Enter the following program :

- Test this new program out
- You might want to make the case for situation 4 a little better...
- Change the speed of the motors
- What could you possibly add to make this more fun?
